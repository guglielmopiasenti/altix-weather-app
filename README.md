# WeatherWiz: Your Local Weather App

Welcome to the WeatherWiz app! This is a Vue.js-based application that provides real-time weather information. Follow these instructions to set up and run the WeatherWiz project on your local machine.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- Git
- npm (Node Package Manager)
- Supabase access


## Cloning the Repository

To get started, you need to clone the WeatherWiz repository to your local machine. Open your terminal and run the following command:

`git clone https://github.com/guglielmopiasenti/altix-weather-app.git`

This command will create a copy of the WeatherWiz repository in your local environment.

## Installing Dependencies

Once the repository is cloned, navigate to the project directory:

`cd weatherwiz`

Now, install the necessary dependencies using npm:


`npm install`

This command will install all the dependencies defined in the package.json file.

## Building the Project

To build the project for production, run the following command:


`npm run build`

This will create a dist folder containing the production build of your app.

## Running in Development Mode

To run WeatherWiz in development mode, use the following command:

`npm run serve`

This will start the Vue.js development server. You can access the app at http://localhost:5173/ (or a different port if 5173 is in use).
